# Task-Queue
 Task queue is a mechanism to distribute a sequence of tasks among parallel threads of execution. The main problem is broken down into tasks and the tasks are enqueued onto the queue. So, parallel threads of execution pull tasks from the queue and execute computations on the tasks.
 
 A task can be defined as an encapsulation of a function inside an object, so when we use tasks we want to transform our methods into classes, that way we can use object operators with them.
We want to call the function we encapsulated in DoTask() method, so we can access the function and use it as an object. Check example.
